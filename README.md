I have started using my own "distro"-ish [CrabbyVim](https://github.com/Mouthless-Stoat/CrabbyVim). THis repo are kept for older version of my config.

- `old` refer to the first config ever written
- `v2` is the updated version I wrote about 10 months later.
- `v3` is a partial version of CrabbyVim that was in middle of devlopment before I move to the new repo. This was written about 1 year after after several breaking changes and dramatic slowdown of the old config.
